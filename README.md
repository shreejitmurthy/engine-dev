## About
This one singular page serves as the sprawling thoughts of Shree (me) as I attempt to develop a game engine from scratch.

So, why? Why am I making a game engine? It’s a daunting task, no doubt—very few get past the initial stages of engine development. So, why am I doing this? Well, it’s simple: I love the idea of it. The phrase "*from scratch*" just sounds awesome, and the thought of building something from the ground up and watching it grow is something I truly yearn for.

I also see this as a fantastic learning opportunity. Most of my projects have been around ~5k lines of code, so managing a larger project like a game engine will give me valuable skills that (I believe) are useful in the industry. Plus, I just love games and game development. That said, I’m a terrible game developer and can never seem to finish a game. I’ve made games from scratch before, and I’m currently working on one in OpenGL and C++. I think this project will also prepare me well for my upcoming university degree, which starts soon.

Since finishing 12th grade in 2024, I’ve had a lot of free time—or at least I did, since much of it went into relaxing after a grueling year of studies. Now, I’m channeling that time into this project.

At the end of development (if there ever *is* an end), I hope to have a functioning engine capable of creating both 2D and 3D games. Honestly, any 3D engine can make a 2D game, since graphics APIs work in 3D by default, but I’d love for my engine to handle both seamlessly.

This series of blog posts is primarily to keep myself motivated, but it might also help me learn from my mistakes—and who knows? Maybe it’ll serve as a little showcase for future employers. My programming knowledge is entirely self-taught, so I’m not entirely sure about best industry practices yet. However, with my computing degree starting soon, I’m confident my code will gradually become more professional and aligned with industry standards over time.
